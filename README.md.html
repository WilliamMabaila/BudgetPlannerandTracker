<a name="l50"><span class="ln">50   </span></a><span class="s2">Considering potential refactoring to improve the design one aspect that stands </span>
<a name="l51"><span class="ln">51   </span></a><span class="s2">out is the relationship between `FinancialTracker` and the `Income` and `Expense` classes. </span>
<a name="l52"><span class="ln">52   </span></a><span class="s2">Currently, the `FinancialTracker` class directly manages multiple `Income` and `Expense` objects which can lead to a </span>
<a name="l53"><span class="ln">53   </span></a><span class="s2">high degree of coupling between these classes and may make the `FinancialTracker` class overly complex.</span>
<a name="l54"><span class="ln">54   </span></a>
<a name="l55"><span class="ln">55   </span></a><span class="s2">To address this, we could introduce a new class named `TransactionManager` that would be responsible for </span>
<a name="l56"><span class="ln">56   </span></a><span class="s2">managing `Income` and `Expense` objects. This class would act as an intermediary between `FinancialTracker` and </span>
<a name="l57"><span class="ln">57   </span></a><span class="s2">the `Income` and `Expense` classes thereby adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">SRP</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">by allowing </span>
<a name="l58"><span class="ln">58   </span></a><span class="s2">`FinancialTracker` to focus on core functionalities without directly managing the transactions. The `TransactionManager` </span>
<a name="l59"><span class="ln">59   </span></a><span class="s2">class would have a one-to-many association with both `Income` and `Expense` and a one-to-one association </span>
<a name="l60"><span class="ln">60   </span></a><span class="s2">with `FinancialTracker`. This refactoring could simplify the `FinancialTracker` class, making the system more modular </span>
<a name="l61"><span class="ln">61   </span></a><span class="s2">and easier to maintain.</span>
<a name="l62"><span class="ln">62   </span></a>
<a name="l63"><span class="ln">63   </span></a><span class="s2">While this introduces an additional layer of abstraction which could be seen as a tradeoff in terms of increased </span>
<a name="l64"><span class="ln">64   </span></a><span class="s2">complexity, it offers the benefit of a cleaner separation of concerns. This makes the system more flexible and open to </span>
